## About The Project

"Culinary Canvas" is a web application designed for the modern home cook. It addresses the common problem of finding great recipes online (especially on video platforms) but having no elegant way to save, organize, and use them later.

This app provides a beautiful, card-based interface to create a visual library of your cooking journey. The standout feature is the **"Follow Along" mode**, which integrates a video player with an interactive step-by-step checklist, making it seamless to cook from your saved inspirations.
